'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences
of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''
def count_th(word):
    # Plan 1:
    # Base case should be if a word is < 2, if so, return 0
    # then...basically go through each of the letters looking for a paired 'th'

    
    
    pass
